    <h1>DevOops</h1>
    
    <p>In a moment of command-blindness today, I managed to delete my entire repo of developing projects. No harm, of course — they were all git repos, and backed up on the internet. Simple matter of going to BitBucket and re-cloning, right? So, first things first — grab my last project, re-clone it, get back to working in no time.</p>
<p>Except when I tried to re-compile, it failed. At 5%. Looking like this.</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/.11ty/image/?src=content%2F2017%2F2017-01-23_DevOops%2Fopengl.png&width=934&format=webp&via=transform 934w"><img src="/.11ty/image/?src=content%2F2017%2F2017-01-23_DevOops%2Fopengl.png&width=934&format=jpeg&via=transform" alt="OpenGL Missing" width="934" height="176"></picture>
How the hell was I not finding ‘OpenGL/gl.h’?</p>
<p>I still don’t know quite what I did, but it only took 20 minutes for me to go from rendering collision-detecting dogs to not being able to compile squat.</p>
<p>Two hours, a half dozen fix attempts, and many StackOverflow tabs later, I get to this:  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18647976/missing-opengl-headers-on-mac">Missing OpenGL Headers on Mac</a> , which linked to yet another StackOverflow question … It turns out that even if you have Xcode installed, Command Line Tools doesn’t come with it anymore. Which means the headers I was looking for didn’t even exist at this point. Bully.</p>
<p>At least the fix was easy. TLDR:</p>
<pre><code>xcode-select —install
</code></pre>
<p>Running the above launches a dialogue that allows you to install CLT. And now we’re all back up and running! How did I somehow remove my Command Line Tools and OpenGL headers? Still no idea. A few misfired commands can go a long way. Thanks, version control!</p>
