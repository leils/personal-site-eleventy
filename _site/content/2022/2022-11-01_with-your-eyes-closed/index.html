  <p>Reflection on Dialog in the Dark, through [<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/19/arts/design/dialog-in-the-dark-at-south-street-seaport-exhibition-review.html">article</a>].</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you think of discomfort as site?</li>
<li>It’s interesting to me that this exhibition/experience focuses on groups of people. The article mentions that the experience encourages teamwork and trust. What does this experience look like without the group? Without the guide?</li>
<li>“The only way to learn is through encounter.” What does online “encounter” look like? TikTok? YouTube? What makes change today?</li>
</ul>
<p>Reflection on The Red Chamber, through [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrF_8q_QyxA">video</a>], [<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/17/arts/dream-of-the-red-chamber-and-other-sleep-oriented-shows.html">article</a>].</p>
<ul>
<li>Subconsciousness as site; it occurs to me that subconsciousness is present as site in waking audiences as well as sleeping ones.</li>
<li>“I think some shows are really wonderful when you’re half-asleep, and it’s washing over you.” I love this. Kind of … person’s status as a thing to consider.</li>
<li>It’s hard for me to conceive of my work being transferred/experienced through sleep.</li>
