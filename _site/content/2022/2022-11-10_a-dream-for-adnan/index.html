  <p>A bespoke experience for <a href="https://adnanaga.com/">Adnan</a>, based on a dream he described to me. See <a href="https://www.leiac.me/2022/2022-11-01_dreamscape-moodboard/">last week’s moodboard</a> for more context.</p>
<pre><code>Instructions to experience this dream:

- Place yourself in a dark room, sitting upright.
- Ensure that the screen is no farther than 15 inches from your face, at eye level
- Turn your screen brightness up.
- Put in headphones.
- Close your eyes, and press play.

Keep your eyes closed for the entire experience.

<p>The intention of the experience is to abstractly suggest movement, and leave the impression of Adnan’s original dream narrative.</p>
<p>I began by re-creating the narrative in sound, using found and gathered clips to generate a sense of the oceanside, misty environment.</p>
<p>I then created a video controller in Touchdesigner that let me control yellow bars crossing a black screen. I choreographed this video to the soundtrack, and then exported and combined the two in Davinci Resolve.</p>
<p>If you decide to engage with the experience, please reach out and let me know how it goes.</p>
