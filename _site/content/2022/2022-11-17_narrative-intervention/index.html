  <p>Explorations in narrative, and how interventions change experience.</p>
<p>I began this set of exercises with this photo: one of many sent to me by my parents. I had not seen this photo before, and had no context for it other than knowing that it depicted myself and my father, somewhere in or near New York.</p>

<p>My first intervention more obscuring, this time with multiple layers. I was looking to represent the distance I felt from this image, and my own fogginess in these memories.</p>

<p>After seeing these obscurations, I found myself with more questions than answers. My next exploration was an added narrative; to embody mine, I layered these questions and their subsequent answers over the obscuration layers. I envision this piece as a double-sided photo; one side with the questions, the other the answers, spinning slowly in the air.</p>

<p>While this was an interesting experiment, I found myself in the end feeling more disconnected to the memory and my family than before Iâ€™d started. I seek connection from my work, to feel more grounded through the process of making it.</p>
