    <p><a href="https://leils.github.io/web-sites/">Explore all the sites here.</a></p>
<p>In early 2024 I embarked on a personal challenge to make a website a day.
The criteria for the websites are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each site focuses on the browser as a medium.</li>
<li>Each site is self-contained and static.</li>
<li>Each site uses HTML, JS, and CSS. No frameworks, no external libraries, no databases.</li>
<li>Each site is made within 1 day (from waking to sleeping). No carry-overs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result was 30 consecutive days of websites exploring novel interactions and precious moments within the browser. This included experiments in <a href="https://leils.github.io/web-sites/asterisk_drawing.html">drawing with HTML</a>, in <a href="https://leils.github.io/web-sites/flashlight.html">revealing hidden things</a>, in using <a href="https://leils.github.io/web-sites/10to10.html">sliders</a> and <a href="https://leils.github.io/web-sites/ripple.html">selectors</a> and <a href="https://leils.github.io/web-sites/stickynotebrain.html">pop-ups</a> as tools for expression.
This repository became a lab for browser experimentation, and remains as a record of those trials.</p>
