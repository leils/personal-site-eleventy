Reflection on Dialog in the Dark, through [[article](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/19/arts/design/dialog-in-the-dark-at-south-street-seaport-exhibition-review.html)].

- How do you think of discomfort as site?
- It’s interesting to me that this exhibition/experience focuses on groups of people. The article mentions that the experience encourages teamwork and trust. What does this experience look like without the group? Without the guide?
- “The only way to learn is through encounter.” What does online “encounter” look like? TikTok? YouTube? What makes change today?

Reflection on The Red Chamber, through [[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrF_8q_QyxA)], [[article](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/17/arts/dream-of-the-red-chamber-and-other-sleep-oriented-shows.html)].

- Subconsciousness as site; it occurs to me that subconsciousness is present as site in waking audiences as well as sleeping ones.
- “I think some shows are really wonderful when you’re half-asleep, and it’s washing over you.” I love this. Kind of … person’s status as a thing to consider.
- It’s hard for me to conceive of my work being transferred/experienced through sleep.
