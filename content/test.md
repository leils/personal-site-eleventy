[Explore all the sites here.](https://leils.github.io/web-sites/)

In early 2024 I embarked on a personal challenge to make a website a day. 
The criteria for the websites are as follows: 

- Each site focuses on the browser as a medium. 
- Each site is self-contained and static. 
- Each site uses HTML, JS, and CSS. No frameworks, no external libraries, no databases. 
- Each site is made within 1 day (from waking to sleeping). No carry-overs. 

The result was 30 consecutive days of websites exploring novel interactions and precious moments within the browser. This included experiments in [drawing with HTML](https://leils.github.io/web-sites/asterisk_drawing.html), in [revealing hidden things](https://leils.github.io/web-sites/flashlight.html), in using [sliders](https://leils.github.io/web-sites/10to10.html) and [selectors](https://leils.github.io/web-sites/ripple.html) and [pop-ups](https://leils.github.io/web-sites/stickynotebrain.html) as tools for expression. 
This repository became a lab for browser experimentation, and remains as a record of those trials.
